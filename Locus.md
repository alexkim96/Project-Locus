# Project-Locus

On the face of it, running a small business can be very difficult, especially when you go head to head with a larger competitor. With limited resources and marketing power, local businesses cannot possibly compete with larger suppliers.
           
           
           Acknowledging these difficulties, the fundamental objective of thee mobile app, “Locus,” is allowing local business owners to provide advertisements and information about their business to the people near their business location. By doing so, this app would allow local businesses to successfully promote their services to the market.
